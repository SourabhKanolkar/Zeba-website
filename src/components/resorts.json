But we arrived at 3pm and sailed up the busy main channel to a very crowded large lagoon and then returned to the same channel again and tied up to a riverbank at 6pm. Boats are not allowed to sail after to 6pm to reduce pollution and give the fisherman an opportunity to fish. You have to keep doors and windows firmly closed as masses of insects desend on the boat. There are almost 1000 boats on the waterway so it can be very busy when they all motor away from their moorings at 8am. The narrow backwaters are not navagable as the boats are too big and also they are choked by water hyacinth."
